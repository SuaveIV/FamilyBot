# Family Bot

This project is a modified version of the original "FamilyBot" created by Chachigo. I have made significant improvements and refactorings to the codebase.
**Original Source:** [Chachigo/FamilyBot](https://github.com/Chachigo/FamilyBot)

## Introduction

Family Bot is a Discord bot primarily designed to notify about new games that are added to the Steam Family library. Plugins can be made to add functionalities using the [interactions.py](https://interactions-py.github.io/interactions.py/) library.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modern Python package structure:

```bash
FamilyBot/

```

## How It Works

FamilyBot consists of several interconnected components:

### Main Bot (`FamilyBot.py`)

- **Discord Bot**: Handles all Discord interactions using interactions.py
- **Plugin System**: Automatically loads plugins from the `plugins/` directory
- **Database Management**: SQLite database for caching game data, wishlists, and user information
- **WebSocket Server**: Receives tokens from the Token_Sender component
- **Command-line Interface**: Supports cache management and maintenance operations

### Token Sender Plugin (`plugins/token_sender.py`)

- **Automated Token Extraction**: Uses Playwright with Chromium to extract Steam web API tokens
- **Integrated Plugin**: Runs as a plugin within the main bot process (no separate WebSocket communication needed)
- **Enhanced Session Management**: Uses explicit storage state saving for reliable Steam login persistence
- **Admin Commands**: Provides `!force_token` and `!token_status` commands for monitoring and control
- **Easy Setup**: Automated browser profile creation with `scripts/setup_browser.py`

### Legacy Token Sender (`Token_Sender/getToken.py`)

- **Deprecated**: Original standalone Selenium-based implementation (preserved for reference)
- **Migration Complete**: New plugin provides all functionality with significant improvements

### Plugin Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Each feature is implemented as a separate plugin
- **Auto-loading**: Plugins are automatically discovered and loaded at startup
- **Extensible**: New functionality can be added by creating new plugin files

### Database System

- **SQLite Backend**: Lightweight, file-based database for data persistence
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching of Steam API responses to minimize API calls
- **Performance Optimization**: Pre-populated price data for faster deal detection

## Installation

To install the bot, clone or unzip the repository archive.

### Requirements

This bot is compatible with **Python 3.13 and above.**
We use `uv` for blazing-fast dependency management and virtual environment creation.

### Dependencies

The project uses the following main dependencies (defined in `pyproject.toml`):

- **discord-py-interactions**: Modern Discord bot framework
- **requests**: HTTP library for API calls
- **selenium**: Web automation for token extraction
- **webdriver-manager**: Automatic WebDriver management
- **websockets**: WebSocket communication between components
- **PyYAML**: Configuration file parsing
- **tqdm**: Progress bars for long-running operations
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for improved performance

### Setup

To set up your development environment, navigate to the project's root directory (`FamilyBot/`) in your terminal (PowerShell 7+ recommended on Windows, or Bash on macOS/Linux) and run the appropriate script:

**For Windows (PowerShell 7):**

```powershell
.\reinstall_bot.ps1
```

**For macOS/Linux (Bash):**

```bash
chmod +x ./reinstall_bot.sh # Make the script executable first
./reinstall_bot.sh
```

This script will:

- Create a new Python virtual environment (.venv).
- Install all necessary Python libraries (including interactions.py, selenium, PyYAML, requests, websockets, webdriver_manager) into the virtual environment.
- Ensure the project's internal modules are correctly configured.

### Discord Bot Creation

1. Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord account.
2. Click on **New Application** and set the name you want for your bot.
3. In the **"OAuth2" -> "General"** section, set the **"Install Link" to `None`**.
    ![Bot Disable Link](doc/Bot_Disable_Link.png)
4. Navigate to the **"Bot"** section:
    - Disable **"Public Bot"**.
    - Under **"Privileged Gateway Intents"**, enable all intents (currently, only the message content intent is essential, but others may be required in future updates).
    ![Bot Permission1](doc/Bot_Permission1.png)
5. To add the bot to your Discord server, go to **"OAuth2" -> "URL Generator"**:
    - In the "scopes" part, check `bot`.
    - In "Bot Permissions", check `Administrator`.
    - Copy the generated URL at the bottom and open it in a new tab.
    ![Bot Generated Link](doc/Bot_Generated_Link.png)
6. It will ask you to connect and select the server where you want to add the bot.
    ![Bot Add](doc/Bot_Add.png)
7. Grant the administrator permissions by clicking **Authorize**.
8. Finally, to get your bot's token: In the **"Bot"** section, click on **"Reset Token"** and copy the token. Save it temporarily, as you'll need it for configuration.

## Configuration

The bot uses two separate configuration files for its different components.

### Main Bot Configuration (`config.yml`)

The main bot uses `config.yml` for its settings. First, fill in the required data in the `config-template.yml` file located in your **project's root directory** (`FamilyBot/`) and then **rename it to `config.yml`**.

#### Discord IDs

To get Discord IDs (for yourself or channels):

- **User ID:** Enable Developer Mode in Discord's **User Settings -> App Settings -> Advanced**. Then, right-click on a user's profile picture and select "Copy ID".
- **Channel ID:** Right-click on a Discord channel and select "Copy ID".

#### Steam IDs and API Keys

The bot interacts with several Steam APIs. There are two distinct types of Steam keys/tokens you'll encounter:

1. **Steamworks Web API Key:** Used for accessing most public Steam Web API endpoints (e.g., `IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames`, `IWishlistService/GetWishlist`, `IFamilyGroupsService/GetSharedLibraryApps`). This is a developer-specific key.
    - **To Obtain:** Go to [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Register a domain (you can use `localhost` for development) and generate your key. This key goes into the `steamworks_api_key` field in your `config.yml`.

2. **Steam Web API Token (`webapi_token`):** This is a client-side token, usually obtained from your browser session, and is specifically used by the `Token_Sender` bot for actions that might mimic browser interaction (e.g., if you had features related to Steam Points Shop or specific client-side Steam features).

    - **To Get `webapi_token`:** Go to [https://store.steampowered.com/pointssummary/ajaxgetasyncconfig](https://store.steampowered.com/pointssummary/ajaxgetasyncconfig). Log in to Steam in another tab, then refresh the token tab. Copy the `webapi_token` value (in quotes). This token is *automatically collected* by the `Token_Sender` bot using Selenium and sent to the main bot via WebSocket. You don't need to manually put this into `config.yml`.

#### Steam Family ID

To get your Steam Family ID:

1. Use a site like [https://steamapi.xpaw.me/](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/).
2. Fill in the "Token" and "Steam ID" fields on this site (you'll need a Steamworks Web API Key for the "Token" field for `xpaw.me` to function).
3. For your Steam ID (SteamID64): Go to [https://steamdb.info/calculator/](https://steamdb.info/calculator/), paste your profile URL, and your Steam ID will be displayed.
    ![Steam ID](doc/Steam_ID.png)
4. After the values are filled on `xpaw.me`, navigate to [https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#IFamilyGroupsService/GetFamilyGroupForUser](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#IFamilyGroupsService/GetFamilyGroupForUser) and click "Execute".
5. Your Family ID will be displayed in quotes.
6. To get other family user IDs (SteamID64s), use [https://steamdb.info/calculator/](https://steamdb.info/calculator/) with their profile URLs.

#### IsThereAnyDeal API Key

1. Create an account on [https://isthereanydeal.com/](https://isthereanydeal.com/).
2. Once logged in, go to [https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/my/](https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/my/) and create a new application.
3. Copy the API key displayed there.
    ![ITAD API KEY](doc/ITAD_API_KEY.png)

### Token Sender Configuration (`config.yaml`)

The `Token_Sender` bot is a separate Python script (`getToken.py`) located in the `src/familybot/Token_Sender/` subdirectory. It requires:

- **Firefox** (installed on your system).
- **Python 3.13+** (managed by your bot's virtual environment).

#### Configure Firefox for Selenium

Since the `webapi_token` can only be reliably obtained from a browser logged into Steam, `Token_Sender` uses Selenium.

1. You need to create a dedicated Firefox profile. In Firefox's address bar, type **`about:profiles`** and press Enter.
2. Click on **"Create a New Profile"**.
    ![Create Firefox Profile](doc/Create_Firefox_Profile.png)
3. **Note the path of this new profile**, as you will need it for the `Token_Sender`'s configuration.
4. Start this new profile in a new browser window and log in to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).

#### Token Sender Configuration File

The `Token_Sender` bot has its own configuration. First, copy the template file `src/familybot/Token_Sender/config-template.yaml` to `src/familybot/Token_Sender/config.yaml`. Then, fill in the required data in `src/familybot/Token_Sender/config.yaml`:

- **`server_ip`**: The IP address of the main FamilyBot's WebSocket server. Use the same IP address you set for `websocket_server_ip` in the main bot's `config.yml` (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local).
- **`token_save_path`**: The directory where the `webapi_token` and its expiration timestamp will be saved. We recommend using a relative path like `"tokens/"` (which will create a `FamilyBot/tokens/` folder).
- **`shutdown`**: Set to `true` if you want your computer to shut down after the token is successfully sent (mostly for dedicated systems; set to `false` for development).
- **`firefox_profile_path`**: The **complete path** to the Firefox profile you created in the previous step. Ensure you use **forward slashes (`/`)** or escaped backslashes (`\\`) in the path.

## Running the Bot

### Token Sender Setup (First Time Only)

Before running the bot for the first time, you need to set up the Steam login session for the token sender plugin:

```bash
# Set up browser profile with Steam login (run once)
uv run python scripts/setup_browser.py
```

This will:

1. Open a Chromium browser window
2. Navigate to Steam login page
3. Allow you to log into Steam manually
4. Save your login session for the token sender plugin

### Running the Main Bot

The main entry point is `src/familybot/FamilyBot.py`. The token sender now runs as an integrated plugin, so you only need to start one process.

From the `FamilyBot/` project root directory:

**Option 1: Using Script Aliases (Recommended):**

```bash
# Run the bot (works on all platforms)
uv run familybot

# Set up browser profile with Steam login
uv run familybot-setup

# Test token extraction functionality
uv run familybot-test
```

**Option 2: Direct Python Execution:**

**For Windows (PowerShell 7):**

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the bot
uv run python .\src\familybot\FamilyBot.py
```

**For macOS/Linux (Bash):**

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source ./.venv/bin/activate

# Run the bot
uv run python ./src/familybot/FamilyBot.py
```

### Legacy Launch Scripts (For Backward Compatibility)

The old launch scripts are still available but now only start the main bot since the token sender is integrated:

- **For Windows (PowerShell 7):**

    ```powershell
    .\run_bots.ps1
    ```

- **For macOS/Linux (Bash):**

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./run_bots.sh # Make the script executable first
    ./run_bots.sh
    ```

### Command-line Arguments

The main bot (`FamilyBot.py`) supports several command-line arguments for maintenance operations:

```bash
# Cache management operations
uv run python .\src\familybot\FamilyBot.py --purge-cache          # Purge game details cache
uv run python .\src\familybot\FamilyBot.py --purge-wishlist      # Purge wishlist cache
uv run python .\src\familybot\FamilyBot.py --purge-family-library # Purge family library cache
uv run python .\src\familybot\FamilyBot.py --purge-all           # Purge all cache data

# Note: --full-library-scan and --full-wishlist-scan require the bot to be running
# Use Discord commands !full_library_scan and !full_wishlist_scan instead
```

---

**Important Notes:**

- You will need **two separate terminal windows** if you run them manually (one for `FamilyBot.py` and one for `getToken.py`).
- Remember to activate the virtual environment (`. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` or `source ./.venv/bin/activate`) in **each terminal window** where you plan to run a bot manually.

---

### Stopping the Bots

To stop the bots, go to their respective terminal windows and press `Ctrl+C`. Both bots have graceful shutdown handling implemented.

## Utility Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains powerful utility scripts for database management and performance optimization:

### Database Population Scripts

- **`populate_database.py`** - Comprehensive database population script that fetches game data, wishlists, and family libraries. Perfect for initial setup or complete rebuilds.
- **`populate_prices.py`** - Specialized price data population script that pre-populates both Steam Store prices and ITAD historical price data for **family wishlist games only**. **Essential for Steam Summer/Winter Sales** to maximize deal detection speed.

### Cache Management Scripts

- **`purge_cache.ps1/.sh`** - Purge game details cache to force fresh USD pricing
- **`purge_wishlist.ps1/.sh`** - Purge wishlist cache when family members update their wishlists
- **`purge_family_library.ps1/.sh`** - Purge family library cache when new games are added
- **`purge_all_cache.ps1/.sh`** - Purge ALL cache data for complete reset

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Populate all data (run after initial setup)
uv run python scripts/populate_database.py

# Prepare for Steam sales (populate price data)
uv run python scripts/populate_prices.py

# During Steam sales (refresh current prices)
uv run python scripts/populate_prices.py --refresh-current --steam-only

# Clear all caches and rebuild
.\scripts\purge_all_cache.ps1
uv run python scripts/populate_database.py
```

For detailed documentation, see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

## Logging System

FamilyBot includes a comprehensive logging system that provides complete visibility into all bot operations, with special focus on private profile detection and error management.

### Log File Structure

All logs are automatically created in the `logs/` directory:

```shell
logs/
├── familybot.log              # Main bot application log (all levels)
├── familybot_errors.log       # Bot errors and critical issues only
├── steam_api.log              # Steam API specific issues (filtered)
├── scripts/
│   ├── populate_database.log  # Database population script logs
│   ├── populate_prices.log    # Price population script logs
│   ├── script_errors.log      # Combined script error log
│   └── [other script logs]    # Individual script logs
└── archived/                  # Auto-rotated old logs
```

### Key Features

- **Automatic Log Rotation**: Main logs rotate at 10MB, error logs at 5MB with multiple backups
- **Security-Conscious**: Automatically masks API keys, tokens, and sensitive data
- **Private Profile Detection**: Special logging for Steam private profile issues
- **Performance Tracking**: Built-in timing and success rate monitoring
- **Error Categorization**: API errors, database errors, and private profiles clearly separated

### Private Profile Monitoring

The logging system provides detailed tracking of private profile issues:

```log
[PRIVATE_PROFILE] username (steam_id): operation blocked - profile is private
```

### Viewing Logs

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# View real-time logs
Get-Content logs\familybot.log -Wait
Get-Content logs\familybot_errors.log -Wait

# Search for specific issues
Select-String "ERROR" logs\familybot.log
Select-String "PRIVATE_PROFILE" logs\familybot.log
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**

```bash
# View real-time logs
tail -f logs/familybot.log
tail -f logs/familybot_errors.log

# Search for specific issues
grep "ERROR" logs/familybot.log
grep "PRIVATE_PROFILE" logs/familybot.log
```

### Log Management

Logs are automatically managed:

- Files rotate when size limits are reached
- Old logs are archived automatically
- All log files are git-ignored for security
- Sensitive data is automatically sanitized

### Help Message

This plugin dynamically generates a help message for all plugin commands. It automatically extracts command details from docstrings formatted as follows within your plugin Python files:

```python
    """
    [help]|!commandName| Description of what the command does| !commandName Arguments | Comment about the command
    """
```

 This ensures the help message is always up-to-date with your bot's latest features.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot won't start**: Check that your `config.yml` is properly configured and all required fields are filled.
2. **Token issues**: Ensure the Token_Sender is running and Firefox profile is properly configured.
3. **Database errors**: Try running the database population scripts or purging cache.
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure the bot has Administrator permissions in your Discord server.

### Getting Help

- Check the logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error information
- Review the configuration files for missing or incorrect values
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed using the reinstall script
- Verify that Firefox is installed and accessible for the Token_Sender component
